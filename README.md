_‚ö†Ô∏è Good news! This project has been abandoned in favor of [pikapkg/web](https://github.com/pikapkg/web). Though I didn‚Äôt start pikapkg/web, I helped contribute all my ideas for Bridge there. So Bridge lives on, in a sense (only better, and working)_

# üåâ Bridge

A bundler that bridges the gap to browser-optimized JavaScript bundling with
native browser ES Modules (ESM).

## Installation

```
npm install --save babel-preset-bridge
```

In any Babel-powered JavaScript project, add `bridge` to your `.babelrc`:

```json
{
  "presets": ["bridge"]
}
```

When you transform your files normally, via webpack or the Babel CLI, this will
transform all your absolute NPM imports from absolute‚Ä¶

```js
import React from 'react';
```

‚Ä¶to relative imports, depending on the file that imported it.

```js
import React from '../../node_modules/react@16.6.0/index.js';
```

This will also tree-shake your Node Modules, and copy them to a
`node_modules` folder in your Babel‚Äôs [compile
directory](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-cli#compile-directories) folder
(‚ö†Ô∏è _Important: this will need to be set in order for this plugin to work_).

## Options

```json
{
  "alias": {
    "react": "react/cjs/react.development.js"
  },
  "sourceMaps": false
}
```

| Name         | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| :----------- | :------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `alias`      | `{}`    | If this module value is encountered, replace with the following (e.g.: the above example will replace every instance of `'react'` with `'react/cjs/react.development.js'` before continuing). The module name must match **exactly.** Similar to webpack‚Äôs alias. |
| `sourceMaps` | `false` | Should source maps be generated in the final output?                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

## CommonJS Support

**This doesn‚Äôt support CommonJS (CJS).**

You‚Äôll know you‚Äôre trying to load a CJS module if it‚Äôs using `require()`. You‚Äôll
probably get an error that looks like this:

```
Uncaught ReferenceError: require is not defined
```

Instead, you‚Äôll either have to load the ESM version that the library ships,
assuming it does, or switch to use another package that supports ESM.

Say by default you‚Äôre used to declaring:

```js
import myModule from 'my-module';
```

Also say that `my-module` loaded the CJS by default, but shipped an ESM
version under `my-module/esm`. Without touching your project, configure
Bridge to handle that for you:

```json
{
  "presets": [
    [
      "bridge",
      {
        "alias": {
          "my-module": "my-module/ejs"
        }
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

In your project, you can still keep writing `import ‚Ä¶ from 'my-module'` but
at compile time it will load the version from `alias`.

### ES Module Support

| Name            | Supports ESM | Planned ESM Support |
| :-------------- | :----------: | :-----------------: |
| `@angular`      |              |                     |
| `apollo-client` |      ‚úÖ      |                     |
| `d3` / `d3-*`   |              |                     |
| `react`         |              |         ‚úÖ          |
| `react-apollo`  |      ‚úÖ      |                     |
| `react-router`  |      ‚úÖ      |                     |
| `vue`           |      ‚úÖ      |                     |

If your preferred NPM package doesn‚Äôt export ESM, ask its maintainer(s)! Many
packages such as React are [already working on
this](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/13272), and if the project
uses [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org) as its bundler, exporting ESM is [as
simple as adding one line to the
config](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en#output-format-f-format).

Because shipping ESM should be a decision of each NPM module (not to mention
converting CJS ‚Üí ESM is _muuuuch_ more difficult than ESM ‚Üí CJS), this
project can‚Äôt support automatic conversion at this time.
