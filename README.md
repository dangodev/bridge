A bundler that bridges the gap to browser-optimized JavaScript bundling.

### Philosophy

Code splitting is a hard problem with bundling that only seems to be getting
more complicated. It not only demands a deep understanding from developers,
but has also caused bundling fatigue over the past several years thatâ€™s not
getting easier.

Now that [most modern browsers support ES
modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import)
and HTTP/2 is standard, thereâ€™s never been a better time to expose bundling
to the browser, and let browsers make their own optimizations.

This bundler aims to be the best of both worldsâ€”all the bells and whistles of
modern JS development, while delivering performant code that browsers can
easily consume.
